# Advent of code 2020
**Made with Xcode 12 and Swift 5.2**

Wanna give Advent Of Code using Swift a go? Try my [Project Template](https://github.com/Dean151/Advent-of-code-Swift-Starter)

## My goal
Trying to solve each puzzle each day.
I hope I'll have enough time and motivation to do so.

## My own rules

All the puzzles will be solved using Swift.

No cheating. Many other persons do the puzzle each day.
I'll have to come up with my own solution ... or skipping a day.

Some code may (and will!) be shared across days.

Not all special cases will always be treated by the code, so it may not work for any input.

Some special attention will be addressed regarding performances, I'll try to solve each day in less than 5 computing seconds!

\* : Best elapsed time of the complete solution using my MacBook Pro 13in mid 2013 in "Release" mode

\*\* : This one is a miracle. 5.5s of computing time in Debug mode, but still, "Release" mode makes miracle happens

\*\*\* : Another best proof that optimisation of "Release" mode are really great. 5.3s in "Debug" mode ; This one can be improved though.
